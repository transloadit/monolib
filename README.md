# :house_with_garden: monolib

A **private** monorepo with **public**ly published single-file JavaScript utils that we can re-use in our different projects.

To many small functions that just don't belong, it's the place they call home.

For example, Uppy has its own way of reporting bytes. We moved that function here, so now we can easily add it to our node-sdk, API, and content repo where React would be outputting bytes in /c/.

Modules are public so they can be re-used without configuring registries and setting tokens for anybody consuming them. This allows the modules to be used in e.g. Uppy or the Node SDK. 

While the world can consume the modules, this is mostly to make life easier for us, we won't encourage people to use these modules in their own projects. Hence, the license is AGPL-3.0-only, and we add unwelcoming READMEs with disclaimers to the modules.

## Rules

- Bundle a Jest test with your function
- Pure functions only please

## How to consume these functions?

In your project, type:

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @transloadit/analyze-step

# npm
npm i @transloadit/analyze-step --save-exact
```

## How to check out this repo locally?

```bash
cd code
git clone git@github.com:transloadit/monolib.git
cd monolib
git pull
yarn
```

## How to add functions?

- Easiest is to duplicate `./package-template` to a directory in `./packages/<name>` and replace any `replace-me` or `replaceMe` occurrence
- Write your function & test
- Add an example to the table in this README.md
- Commit
- Run `npm run pub` to publish (that's just an alias to [`lerna publish`](https://lerna.js.org/#command-publish))

## How to run tests?

```bash
make test-watch

# yarn
yarn test:watch

# npm
npm run test:watch
```

## How to iterate quickly inside a consuming project without publishing 100 versions?

```bash
$ cd ~/code/monolib/packages/analyze-step
$ yarn link
yarn link v1.22.4
success Registered "@transloadit/analyze-step".
info You can now run `yarn link "@transloadit/analyze-step"` in the projects where you want to use this package and it will be used instead.
Done in 0.04s.

$ cd ~/code/content
$ yarn link @transloadit/analyze-step
yarn link v1.22.4
success Using linked package for "@transloadit/analyze-step".
